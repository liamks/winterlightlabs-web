          <h1>Wintelight Labs “Graduates” from the Rotman Creative Destruction Lab</h1>
          <h3>TORONTO, July 14, 2016</h3>

          <p>
            WinterLight Labs has a language-based diagnostic system that can detect
            several cognitive conditions and is pleased to announce it has graduated
            from the Rotman Business School’s Creative Destruction Lab (CDL).
            The CDL works with startups that employ innovations in technology and
            business models that promise a chance of delivering massive improvements
            to economic productivity and human welfare.  Co-Founder and CEO Liam Kaufman
            said, “We’re pleased to have received such great support from The CDL,”
            and added “The team there added immense value to our strategy, business
            plan and positioning that will undoubtedly contribute to our commercial
            success. And since my co-founders and myself were all U of T Grads,
            it was a natural fit with CDL”.
          </p>

          <p>
            WinterLight Labs’ platform can analyze natural speech to detect
            and monitor dementia, Alzheimer’s, aphasia, and various cognitive conditions.
            Using short recorded samples of a person’s speech (of one to five minutes),
            the scalable platform analyzes hundreds of linguistic cues and can detect
            dementia and other conditions at a level of accuracy between 85% and 100%,
            which is better than current methods.  The platform has applications in drug trials,
            long-term care facilities, and speech-language pathology – anywhere that a fast,
            simple speech-based tool is required for assessment or monitoring.
            Current pencil-and-paper tests are time-consuming, costly, and
            difficult to administer to clients with cognitive disorders.
          </p>

          <h2>About WinterLight Labs</h2>
          <p>

            analyze hundreds of linguistic cues, and can detect dementia and other
            conditions with a high level of accuracy-. This is a major improvement

            and difficult to administer. The platform has applications in drug trials,
            long-term and primary care, and speech-language pathology.

          <p>
            Since its founding, has seen strong interest from pharmaceutical companies
            and other potential partners who view the technology as a major improvement

            support from the pan-Canadian AGE-WELL Network of Centres of Excellence (NCE),
            the Ontario Brain Institute, Ontario Centres of Excellence, and the
